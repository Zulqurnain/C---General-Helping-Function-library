# C---General-Helping-Function-library
It consist of wide variety of C functions , which can be used in any task , you can add your own function and make this library big.

Here are some functions already implemented :

*   chrand(initial ch,final ch) >>> it will randomize character from initial character to final character.

*   stf() >>it will input single precision number and convert to respective float decimal.

*   fts()  >> it will convert floating point (decial) to binary 32 bit single precision representation.

*   paliornot(int num) >> it will find that any number is palindrome or not return 1 if pali & if not return 0

*   divideshow(int arr[]) >> To get Values of numerator and denominator as (1/2) + (3/4) === (arr[0]/arr[1]) + (arr[3]/arr[4])

*   displayMCIF(double distance) >> it will take distance as input and convert and display its respective METERS / Centimeters / Inches / Feet

*   displayAP(double l,double b) >> // it will take any two of input as width , length ,breath and Calculate and display area and parimeters of given inputs.

*   gsales1(double fixed_sal,int days,int percentage)

--- it calculates the totlal salary of employ by adding gross salary of given days and percentage of gross profit
--- (Fixed_salary , Number_of_days ,percent_nuber) // percent_number = 9 , if 9%

*   evenoddchar() // it will get a character as input don't echo it and convert even char to odd and odd char to even e.g p=evenoddchar();

*	tictac() // it is a complete tictac toe game idiot computer + user play but not computer never loss. 

*	selecsort(int[],int) selection sort integer array array[],SIZE

*	selecsort(char) selection sort character array

*	bsearch(int[],int,int) binary search of integer array (array , SIZE , search_value)

*	bsearch(char[],char) binary search of character array (array , character_to_search)

*	passpro(char[]) password protecter ("PASSWORD") or ("12345") or (password[]) it will return 1 if matched if not then 0

*	parr(int[],int) print integer array (array,SIZE)

*	parr(char[]) print character array till null character (array)

*   void printAsBits(uint32_t);  take an integer of type uint32_t and print it as 32 bits binary

*   bool bubbleSort(T* arr, int size);  take any type of array and its size and bubble sort it , T variable should have '<' operator overloaded  

*   int numOfBytesInFile(FILE*);  take FILE* and return number of bytes in a file
